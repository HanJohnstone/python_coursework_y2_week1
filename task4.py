# Task 4
# You have a list of numbers having values from 1 to n, each occurring only once.
# The list is unordered.
# An unknown amount of values is missing 
# The number n is the maximum value of the list.
# Write a function to output the missing numbers sorted by value.

# Example: miss_nums_finder([8, 10, 11, 7, 3, 15, 6, 14, 5, 12])  ==> [1, 2, 4, 9, 13]
# Pay attention that number 1 is not in the input above but it should be in the output.
