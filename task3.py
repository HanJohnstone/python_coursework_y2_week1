# Task 3
# Write a function that takes two
# lists of integers of equal sizes as parameters.
# The parameter height_in is a list of heights in inches.
# The parameter weight_lb is a list of weights in pounds.
# Write a function that calculates BMIs using both lists.

# bmi = weight(kg) / height(m) * height(m)

#  Multiply weight_lb by 0.453592 to go from pounds to kilograms.
#  Multiply height_in by 0.0254 to convert height measurements from inches to meters
# Round to 2 decimal places


# Example: bmi([74,69],[180,210]) ==> [23.11, 31.01]
